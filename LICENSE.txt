If you¡¯d like to build Spark from source, visit Building Spark.

Spark runs on both Windows and UNIX-like systems (e.g. Linux, Mac OS). It¡¯s easy to run locally on one machine ¡ª all you need is to have java installed on your system PATH, or the JAVA_HOME environment variable pointing to a Java installation.

Spark runs on Java 8+, Python 2.7+/3.4+ and R 3.1+. For the Scala API, Spark 2.3.1 uses Scala 2.11. You will need to use a compatible Scala version (2.11.x).

Note that support for Java 7, Python 2.6 and old Hadoop versions before 2.6.5 were removed as of Spark 2.2.0. Support for Scala 2.10 was removed as of 2.3.0.
